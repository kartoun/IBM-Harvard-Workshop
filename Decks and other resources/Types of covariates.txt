The variety of covariate types could be categorized into classes, ranked by their level of ease in
collection and construction.

Covariates collected by looking at the patient, such as gender or race, are the easiest
to capture because they require neither any interaction with the patient nor any measurements or calculations.

Covariates such as age, marital status, mood status, pain level, alcohol use, and tobacco use require only
minimal interaction with the patient. Capturing covariates such as weight, height, and blood pressure can be
accomplished within a few minutes because they require the use of easily accessible equipment available in any
physician’s office.

At an intermediate level of complexity are the patient’s laboratory test results (such as
creatinine, hemoglobin, and glucose)—such covariates require analysis of urine or blood samples by an external
laboratory with more advanced measurement devices than those found in a standard outpatient setting.
Processing measurements stored in the EMR can be challenging given the heterogeneity of measurement units
and reference values that are often unique to a certain measurement.

Of a higher complexity are covariates representing the genetic profile of the patient, often requiring an external specialized laboratory and associated with high costs to process.

Another set of covariates commonly used to classify and predict patient outcomes include those
extracted from clinical narrative notes (such as progress notes, operation notes, and discharge summaries)—
such covariates require the use of advanced NLP and machine leaning algorithms and often require timeconsuming manual chart reviews, typically performed by physicians and nurses.

Additional covariates rely on the use of wearable devices that are often integrated with the patient’s EMR—such
covariates require the application of advanced time series classification techniques on the collected data that
represent large collections of continuous and often noisy values.
